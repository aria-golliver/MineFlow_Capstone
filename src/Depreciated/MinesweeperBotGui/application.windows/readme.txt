MinesweeperBotGui is the old version of the code, I wanted to re-write it because I felt there were a lot of concurrency problems, especially when I tried to use openGL. (oh lord the bugs that happened with the P2D -> openGL switch)

This program is basically a reference for where I'd like the re-written code to be in by the time it's done.

To make it a screensaver, rename it from
     xxxxxx.exe
to
     xxxxxx.src

then you can 
    rightclick -> install



not recomended on laptops. It'll surely kill your battery life
