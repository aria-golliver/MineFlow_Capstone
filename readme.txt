"Cellular atomata" creative coding project that I came up with and have spent most of my HS senior year working on.

Basically, the cells that are 'lit up' are all chosen by huge games of minesweeper that the computer plays in the background.
Usually multiple games are being played at once (I usually run 3 minesweeper-solver threads) which causes overlap and interference in the output.

I had an old version that I wrote with the processing IDE, but it felt really hacky. This new version is greatly improved in terms of speed, reliability, multithreaded correctness, and code quality.

The Processing development environment is released as open source under the GPL. The export libraries (also known as 'core') are released under an LGPL license, which means they can be used as a library and included in your project without you having to open up your code (though we encourage people to share anyway). But if you make changes to core, you have to submit back to us. More information can be found at
